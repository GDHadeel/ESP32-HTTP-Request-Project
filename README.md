# Task 3: HTTP Request in ESP32 Code to Retrieve Data from Database

## Description
This project demonstrates how to use an ESP32 to retrieve data from a database via HTTP requests. Depending on the data received, the ESP32 controls two LEDs (green and red) to signal whether a specific command is present or not. The simulation is conducted using [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/), an online platform for IoT project simulations.
